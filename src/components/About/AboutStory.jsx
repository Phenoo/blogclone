        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>
        How important is the mind?
        </h4>
        <br />
        <p>
        Your mind is very powerful. You hear statements like, “you did not have the mind for it” “you nor get mind” People usually use the phrase to actualize the important role your mind plays in every moment. What the person was saying is that your mind was not strong enough to carry out that decision or action. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        So, it is right to say every decision first caried out starts in your mind before it is translated to reality, so your mind functions both as a control room and a court room. Every decision starts with you processing it, the cons the pros and ends with a verdict of yes or no. As straight as it sounds, it is a journey going from the control room, where we have analyzed and processed to the court room where we get the verdict yes. In-between that there are many counter thoughts, thoughts expressing themselves in form of worry, fear, anxiety, doubt, condemnation, guilt shame etc. roaming freely especially in our minds courtroom always try to counter every decision we try to make, to ensure we don’t go on with it, a battle field indeed. I am sure you have heard that the mind is like a battle field, and it is not said to scare you out, but to inform you. There are two things that happen in a battle field, its either you win or you lose. Information is power, knowledge is powerful, there is nothing scaring again, now I know that I can win. My only question is how do I win? 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        By developing a fit mind. A fit mind is not a perfect mind that harbors no struggles, worries, or issues, it’s a mind that has been built to be unshakable, irrespective of the situation.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Which begins first with the renewal of your mind. Training your mind to be channeled to the right thoughts, internationally building it to having the right beliefs, and conditioning it to adjust to any circumstance. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        it takes a well-renewed mind to win. 
        </p>

        <br />

        <h4>
          So, what does the 6-pac mind channel on?
        </h4>
        <p>
        It is a mind fitness brand that focuses on the of renewing of the mind, and developing healthy mindsets.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is centered on God’s word because the unshakable mind is a mind of Christ and it does not come from motivational quotes, 
          speeches, and pep talks, it only comes from the word of God. 
          “For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even divisions of soul and spirit, 
          and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the hearts” Heb 4:12. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        Renewing of one’s mind is a constant process, like building a house one block at a time,
        one paint brush stroke after another, just like losing weight, you lose the fat then gain muscle. 
        So, the 6-Pac mind functions like an actual gym in the sense that it requires, 
        a level consistency and intentionality. Constantly learning, unlearning and relearning. 
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
        The vision is to have people with fitter minds than fitter bodies
        </p>        
        <br />
        <p>
        The mission is having people who are not weighed down by pressures, 
        or issues of life but can walk and work through them without fear or limiting mindsets and win.
